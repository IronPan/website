Starting from [V0.1.3](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/releases/tag/0.1.3), Kubeflow Pipelines becomes one of the Kubeflow core components. It's automatically deployed during Kubeflow deployment. 

Note: Due to 
[kubeflow/pipelines#345](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/345) and 
[kubeflow/pipelines#337](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/337), Kubeflow Pipelines depends on GCP services and some of the functionalities are not supported by non-GKE cluster.
You can try it currently with a Kubeflow deployment on GKE. See the [GKE setup guide](/docs/started/getting-started-gke/).
